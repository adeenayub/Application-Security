Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice) is a sweetned frozen food typically eatn as a snack or deert. It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors. It is typically sweetened with sugar or sugar substitutes. Typically, flavourings and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorpe air spaces and co below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures. It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

The meaning of the phrase "ice cream" varies from one country to another. Phrases such as "frozen custard", "frozen yogurt", "sorbet", "gelato", and others are used to diinguish different varieties and styles. In some cotries, such as the United States, the phrase "ice cr" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notbly the amnt of cream. Products that do not meet the ceria to be called ice cream are labelled "frozen dairy dessert" instead In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternats, such as goat's or shp's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.
